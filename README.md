# Accident Predictor
This is a simple android app where you can brodcast your location and everyone who has your dynamically generated unique key can track you in near real-time.

I created this project just for learning puposes particularly about firebase (firestore db), google maps api and google location api.

### How it works?
- The first device get continous location update from gps, network etc. then
- Write and update the location data to a specific firebase firestore document
- Last, the second device read that firebase firestore document and show the marker in that location


***
### Hot to integrate Google Maps & Location API
To use google maps in an android app you can use `SupportMapFragment` or `MapView`

- Using google maps fragment (inside a layout or as a root tag)
 
```xml
<fragment
	android:id="@+id/map"
	android:name="com.google.android.gms.maps.SupportMapFragment"
	android:layout_width="match_parent"
	android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```

- Then you have to add permissions and google maps api key in the *AndroidManifest.xml* file

> Add permisions for coase and fine location also add meta-data tag for API key

***
### Integrate Google Play Services for Firebase into android project
- Add this gradle plugin `'com.google.gms:google-services:3.1.1'` into dependencies block of the top-level gradle build file

![](images/gr_1.png)

- Apply the google play services plugin in the app level gradle build file (app project)

![](images/gr_2.png)

- Then you can add google play services library for maps, location, places etc. (firebase needs google play services to operate)

![](images/gr_3.png)

- You need to download and add `google-services.json` file to your `project_name/app/` directory from firebase console when you add an android app to your firebase project
- Here are the complete figure

> enter the app package name & SHA-1 key (optional for firebase auth)

***
### Getting API Key for Google Maps & Location
- Go to the google cloud console page and click credentials submenu (or [Get API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup) )

![](images/ga_1.png)

- Then create a new credential


![](images/ga_2.png)


- New API key has been created, you can copy the key and paste in the manifest file. To restrict access of the key click the restrict button

![](images/ga_3.png)


- You can restrict api key usage by selecting the platform or IP address by which the api call would be requested (Application restrictions)

![](images/ga_4.png)

1. Select one of the application restrictions (in this case Android)
2. Insert your android app package name
3. Insert SHA-1 fingerprint of your app
4. Click Save button

___
> - To get SHA-1 key you can use your android studo by opening your particular project -> select signingReport gradle task -> copy & paste the SHA-1 key into the android app restriction form
